# Football prediction 

An attempt to learn something about predicting football games

Run `basic.py` and `odds.py` to download and manipulate the data sources used for this analysis.
The `basic.py` script will take some time to run.
Then run `prediction.py` to create the predictions.
Finally, if desired, run `graphing.py` to create the graphs.

# Future questions

 - How does the odds prediction score vary over time? (within a season, over seasons)
 - Does a shorter (more recent only) training window help? 
   (since the formation of the PL? Since three points for a win)
 - Does training separately for different tiers make a difference?
 - How predictive are offset form predictions? 
   (predict using the 4th, 3rd and 2nd most recent games only)
 - How does home advantage vary? (over a season, within a season)
